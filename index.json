Example: Change all values in the 'Logging' facet: edgecmd Configuration Storage Logging LogLevel=Warning LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 LogFileCountLimit=5 Configure key=value pairs in a facet Complete the following to configure any number of valid key=value pairs in a facet: Access the EdgeCmd utility through a command line tool.

Configure with JSON Files Configure Edge Data Store by a JSON file input into the EdgeCmd application. A file import completely replaces the existing configurations; therefore, you cannot use it to change individual values in a facet without modifying others. Import bulk configuration Complete the following to import a bulk configuration: Access the EdgeCmd utility through a command line tool. Type the following command, replacing <PathToJsonFile> with the path to the file, and press Enter. edgecmd Configuration file=<PathToJsonFile> Import facet specific configuration Complete the following to import a facet specific configuration file for a component: Access the EdgeCmd utility through a command line tool.

Then press Enter. edgecmd Configuration <componentId> <facetName> file=<PathToJsonFile> Import facets configuration in bulk Complete the following steps to import a file with configuration for individual facets as a bulk file import operation: Note: The file must contain only information for the given component ID. Access the EdgeCmd utility through a command line tool. Type the following command, replacing the file name as shown in the Bulk_Storage_Runtime.json example, and press Enter. edgecmd Configuration file=\"~/Bulk_Storage_Runtime.json\" Example: { \"Storage\": { \"Runtime\": { \"StreamStorageLimitMb\": 66, \"StreamStorageTargetMb\": 33, \"IngressDebugExpiration\": \"2020-07-08T01:00:00\", \"CheckpointRateInSec\": 6, \"TransactionLogLimitMB\": 350, \"EnableTransactionLog\": true } } } Note: The command only affects the specified key-value pairs for the 'Runtime' facet in the 'Storage' component. It does not change any other components or facets; however, import affects all key-value pairs in the facet. If you import the following example JSON file, the 'StreamStorageLimitMb' and 'StreamStorageTargetMb' values will be modified and the remaining values in the 'Runtime' facet will be reset to their default values (IngressDebugExpiration, CheckpointRateInSec, TransactionLogLimitMB, and EnableTransactionLog). { \"Storage\": { \"Runtime\": { \"StreamStorageLimitMb\": 66, \"StreamStorageTargetMb\": 33, } } }"

    "title": "Release notes",
    "keywords": "Release notes EdgeCmd utility 1.1 Overview Edge Data Store (EDS) and PI Adapters have a REST API that allows user interaction. Configuration is one of the most common interactions. This command line tool, EdgeCmd utility, uses this REST API to apply all changes and administration functions to EDS and PI adapters. Specifically, the EdgeCmd utility's command line interface uses configuration and administration functions of the REST API, so the user does not need to know the REST routes. EdgeCmd utility thus improves the user experience, facilitates easier scripting experiences and provides built-in help. For more information, see EdgeCmd utility . Fixes and enhancements Fixes The command line syntax and processing of EdgeCmd utility v1.1 has been entirely reworked from scratch, so there are no specific fixes. Enhancements Changes from version 1.0 A simpler command line syntax is now used. A verb (operation) is added to remove ambiguity between reading, writing, adding, removing, or editing. Command line arguments no longer require a specific order. Reduces the amount of command line arguments by not requiring full path to facets. For example, for egress (PI Adapters) and storage (EDS), no component ID is required. Help output is improved in the following ways: It is more comprehensive for overall program operation. If a PI adapter is available, the help output shows available facets. Available command line arguments are defined. Command line examples are shown in bright color to stand out better. The command line syntax uses -port instead of port to instruct EdgeCmd utility which TCP port to use. Administration support is added to start and stop components, and reset configurations to initial values. Diagnostics support is added. Support for CSV configuration for data selection, for both reading and writing. No change to actual routes for setting or reading configuration although the PI Adapter's REST API port can no longer be modified through EdgeCmd utility. Known issues There are no known issues at this time. System requirements Refer to System requirements . Installation and upgrade Refer to Install EdgeCmd utility . Uninstallation Refer to Uninstall EdgeCmd utility . Security information and guidance OSIsoft’s commitment Because the PI System often serves as a barrier protecting control system networks and mission-critical infrastructure assets, OSIsoft is committed to (1) delivering a high-quality product and (2) communicating clearly what security issues have been addressed. This release of EdgeCmd utility is the highest quality and most secure version of the EdgeCmd utility released to date. OSIsoft's commitment to improving the PI System is ongoing, and each future version should raise the quality and security bar even further. Vulnerability communication The practice of publicly disclosing internally discovered vulnerabilities is consistent with the Common Industrial Control System Vulnerability Disclosure Framework developed by the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group (ICSJWG). Despite the increased risk posed by greater transparency, OSIsoft is sharing this information to help you make an informed decision about when to upgrade to ensure your PI System has the best available protection. For more information, refer to OSIsoft’s Ethical Disclosure Policy (https://www.osisoft.com/ethical-disclosure-policy) . To report a security vulnerability, refer to OSIsoft's Report a Security Vulnerability (https://www.osisoft.com/report-a-security-vulnerability) . Vulnerability scoring OSIsoft has selected the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to quantify the severity of security vulnerabilities for disclosure. To calculate the CVSS scores, OSIsoft uses the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) calculator maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). OSIsoft uses High, Medium and Low categories to aggregate the CVSS Base scores. This removes some of the opinion related errors of CVSS scoring. As noted in the CVSS specification, Base score range from 0 for the lowest severity to 10 for the highest severity. Overview of new vulnerabilities found or fixed This section is intended to provide relevant security-related information to guide your installation or upgrade decision. OSIsoft is proactively disclosing aggregate information about the number and severity of EdgeCmd utility security vulnerabilities that are fixed in this release. No security-related information is applicable to this release. Technical support and resources Refer to Technical support and feedback ."

Examples Configuration help for the System component edgecmd -help Configuration System ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'Logging' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LogLevel [Required] Desired log level settings. Options: Verbose, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal. LogFileSizeLimitBytes [Required] Maximum size in bytes of log files that the service will create for this component. Must be no less than 1000. LogFileCountLimit [Required] Maximum number of log files that the service will create for this component. Must be a positive integer. Example: .\\edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogLevel=Warning Example: .\\edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogFileSizeLimitBytes=32768 Example: .\\edgecmd Configuration System Logging LogFileCountLimit=5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component System command-line options => 'HealthEndpoints' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Id [Optional] Id of existing configuration to be edited of removed.
